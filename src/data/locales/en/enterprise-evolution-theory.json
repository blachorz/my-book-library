    "evolution_coreConcept_subtitle": "Enterprise Evolution Theory",
    "evolution_coreConcept_desc": "The success of a company begins with precise top-level design, not daily operations. This book provides a systematic approach to transform a company from intuitive, random growth to replicable, organic growth to meet internal and external challenges.",

    "evolution_problem1_title_v2": "External Environmental Uncertainty",
    "evolution_problem1_desc": "The external environment is volatile, but business operations require certainty. How to transform external uncertainty into internal certainty is a major challenge.",
    "evolution_problem2_title_v2": "Internal Management Complexity",
    "evolution_problem2_desc": "With rampant growth, various strategies, organizational models, and cultures may emerge internally, leading to increasingly complex management that becomes an enemy of evolution.",
    "evolution_problem3_title_v2": "Fragmentation of Organizational Integrity",
    "evolution_problem3_desc": "Departmental silos, disconnected processes and cultures lead to severe organizational fragmentation (deep-well sickness), preventing synergy.",
    "evolution_problem4_title_v2": "Unclear Business Cause-and-Effect Chains",
    "evolution_problem4_desc": "The inability to clarify the link between 'results' and 'causes,' especially the disconnect between strategy and daily operations, is the biggest gap between knowledge and action in a company.",
    "evolution_problem5_title_v2": "Lifecycle Limitations",
    "evolution_problem5_desc": "Enterprises face the bottleneck of the S-curve lifecycle. Failing to find or choosing the wrong second curve leads to a dilemma of 'waiting for death' or 'seeking death'.",
    "evolution_problem6_title_v2": "Incomplete Business Cycles",
    "evolution_problem6_desc": "A broken chain from strategy, planning, budgeting, performance to incentives leads to employee 'free-riding' and fails to effectively support strategy implementation.",
    "evolution_problem7_title_v2": "Over-reliance on Key Individuals",
    "evolution_problem7_desc": "The success of the enterprise is overly dependent on the founder or a key figure, failing to transform individual leadership into sustainable organizational leadership.",
    "evolution_problem8_title_v2": "Difficulty in Employee Accountability",
    "evolution_problem8_desc": "Employees, the engine of the enterprise, are often treated as passive executors. Their sense of achievement and mission is not stimulated, lacking a culture and mechanism for accountability.",

    "evolution_solution2_title": "Causal Chain Theory: Solving Real Problems by Starting from the Goal",
    "evolution_solution2_desc1": "Problems disappear in the process of pursuing goals, rather than being solved. It is necessary to start from the goal (Y) and work backward to identify key success factors (x).",
    "evolution_solution2_formula": "Y = f(x₁, x₂, x₃, ...)",
    "evolution_solution2_desc2": "Leaders should guide their teams to break out of the 'problem-oriented' loop and focus on variables truly related to the goal, avoiding wasting resources on pseudo-problems.",
    "evolution_solution3_title": "Strategic Deduction Theory: Seize the Trend, Clarify the Path, Optimize the Technique",
    "evolution_solution3_desc1": "Strategy is a dynamic combination of 'goal' and 'path' that needs to be deduced and iterated through a systematic process.",

    "evolution_solution4_title": "Gear Theory and Leadership Theory: Igniting the Organization's Intrinsic Motivation",
    "evolution_solution4_desc1": "A healthy organization should be driven by small gears (employees) turning large gears (the organization), not the other way around. This requires transforming the founder's personal leadership into organizational leadership.",

    "evolution_solution5_title": "Business Cycle Theory: From Philosophy to Mathematics",
    "evolution_solution5_desc1": "Business is the process of translating corporate philosophy into concrete numbers. An idea that cannot be translated into measurable metrics is just empty talk.",

    "evolution_solution7_note": "Refer to John Kotter's 'Eight-Step Process for Leading Change' to carry out designed, step-by-step transformations to create a second curve and avoid becoming a 'small old tree that doesn't grow'.",

    "evolution_scenario1_title": "Scenario 1: The company is stuck in a growth stagnation, and managers are overwhelmed.",
    "evolution_scenario1_desc": "<strong>Application Method:</strong> Apply the 'Causal Chain Theory.' Stop solving problems one by one. Instead, gather the core team to clarify the company's next core objective (Y), such as 'increasing the market share of the core product to 30%.' Then, based on this objective, brainstorm the key driving factors (x) to achieve it and focus all resources on them.",
    "evolution_scenario1_note": "💡 Avoid making 'solving all problems' the goal. Initially, managers need to strongly guide the team to shift away from a problem-oriented mindset.",

    "evolution_case_study_item1": "<strong>Background and Challenges:</strong> When the author took over, the company was plagued with problems, and he himself was on the verge of depression from being stuck in a 'problem-oriented' mode.",
    "evolution_case_study_item2": "<strong>Solution:</strong> After a realization, the author gathered the executive team, stopped discussing specific issues, and held a two-day strategic workshop focused on defining the company's goals (Y) and the path (x) to achieve them.",
