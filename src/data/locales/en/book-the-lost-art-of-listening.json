  "summary_subtitle": "The Lost Art of Listening",
  "summary_desc": "This book explains why listening is a severely underestimated yet crucial skill. It is not only the cornerstone for improving all interpersonal relationships but also key to shaping personal self-esteem and security. By learning to overcome the instinct to rush to speak, handle emotional interference, and use specific techniques like 'reflecting feelings' and 'confirming understanding,' we can become true 'midwives,' helping others clarify their thoughts and feel understood. This gift of empathy and presence to others will ultimately deepen our own life cultivation.",

  "part1_title": "Part 1: Why is Listening Crucial?",
  "part1_vp1_title": "Core Idea 1: Listening is an Underestimated Key Skill",
  "part1_vp1_desc": "Listening is commonly underestimated as a natural ability, but it is actually the most effective way to improve interpersonal relationships (parent-child, workplace, partner) and requires systematic learning to master. Not being listened to is a form of harm, while being listened to can greatly enhance a person's sense of security and self-esteem.",
  "part1_vp2_title": "Core Idea 2: Listening Shapes Personality and Self-Esteem",
  "part1_vp2_desc": "A person's character and self-confidence are deeply influenced by the extent to which they were listened to during their upbringing. Children who are listened to by their parents from a young age grow up with a greater sense of security and a stable core. The foundation of self-esteem begins with parents responding to their infant's sounds, establishing the core belief that they are worthy of attention.",
  "part2_title": "Part 2: Why Don't We Listen?",
  "part2_vp1_title": "The Instinct to Express Ourselves",
  "part2_vp1_desc": "The most fundamental reason people don't listen is that they want to speak themselves. In a conversation, our brain is always preparing what we want to say, rather than focusing on understanding the other person. When a friend comes to vent, we often rush to give advice, but what they truly need is often emotional release.",
  "part2_vp2_title": "Psychological and Emotional Barriers",
  "part2_vp2_desc": "Personal experiences, emotions, and preconceptions are major obstacles to listening. Past traumas, empathy and projection, and emotional defensiveness in the face of criticism put us on guard. Especially with loved ones, concern-driven fear often turns into anger, leading to the most hurtful responses.",
  "part3_title": "Part 3: How to Listen Effectively? — Be a Midwife, Not a Dentist",
  "part3_vp1_title": "Mindset and Basic Techniques",
  "part3_vp1_desc": "Quality listening begins with genuine interest and curiosity. The listener should act as a 'midwife,' helping the other person 'birth' their own ideas, rather than a 'dentist' who rushes to find and fix problems.",
  "part3_vp1_item1": "<strong>Breathe and Focus:</strong> Put away your phone, focus on the other person with your eyes, and create an undisturbed environment.",
  "part3_vp1_item2": "<strong>Ask and Confirm:</strong> Use open-ended questions to guide the other person to express themselves more deeply, and rephrase their points in your own words (`'So, what you mean is... is that right?'`) until they nod in confirmation (`'Yes, that's exactly what I mean.'`).",
  "part3_vp1_item3": "<strong>Acknowledge, Don't Agree:</strong> Understanding and acknowledging the other person's emotions (`'No wonder you're so upset.'`) is key to building connection, but it doesn't mean you have to agree with their position or actions.",
  "part3_vp2_title": "Responsive Listening and Emotional Handling",
  "part3_vp2_desc": "When facing arguments and strong emotions, a structured approach is needed, and 'reflecting feelings' is the most effective tool for handling emotions.",
  "part3_vp2_item1_title": "Responsive Listening Steps",
  "part3_vp2_item1_step1": "Suppress the urge to argue and focus on the other person.",
  "part3_vp2_item1_step2": "Encourage the other person to express all their thoughts and feelings (`'Is there more?'`).",
  "part3_vp2_item1_step3": "Repeat in your own words to show understanding.",
  "part3_vp2_item1_step4": "Let the other person correct your understanding.",
  "part3_vp2_item1_step5": "Delay your response, especially for major issues; you can give your view a day later.",
  "part3_vp2_item2_title": "'Reflecting Feelings' Technique",
  "part3_vp2_item2_desc": "Directly state the emotion you observe in the other person. This can make them feel understood and de-escalate the intensity.",
  "part3_vp2_item2_case1": "<strong>To a child:</strong> 'Daddy knows you want to play a little longer, right?'",
  "part3_vp2_item2_case2": "<strong>To an adult:</strong> 'It sounds like this situation is very frustrating for you.'",
  "part4_title": "Part 4: Listening Strategies for Different Contexts",
  "part4_vp1_title": "Intimate Relationships",
  "part4_vp1_desc": "Stop trying to change your partner; instead, listen to the feelings and needs behind their words. If you want to hear the truth, you must provide enough safety. Use 'I' statements (`'When you..., I feel sad.'`) to express your feelings and avoid generalizations.",
  "part4_vp2_title": "Family Relationships",
  "part4_vp2_desc": "Establish clear system boundaries. Allow children to express 'feelings'; acknowledge their feelings first, then guide them to follow the rules. Avoid nagging and maintain a united front with your partner on discipline.",
  "part4_vp3_title": "Friends and Colleagues",
  "part4_vp3_desc": "Friendships are voluntary; the worst offense is constant judgment. Ask for permission before giving advice (`'I have some thoughts on this, would you like to hear them?'`). Improving relationships starts with changing yourself, not expecting others to change.",
  "section_scenarios": "Practical Guide",
  "scenarios_desc": "Translate the theories from this book into concrete, actionable steps.",
  "scenario1_title": "Create a Listening Environment",

  "scenario2_title": "Practice 'Reflecting Feelings'",
  "scenario2_desc": "When a family member is emotional, practice not lecturing, but first pointing out their feeling, e.g., 'You must feel very wronged right now, don't you?'",

  "scenario4_title": "Ask for Permission to be Heard",
  "scenario4_desc": "When you need to be listened to, make a clear request: 'I'm feeling very confused right now, could you please just listen to me?'",
  "scenario5_title": "When Criticized, First Ask 'Is There More?'",
  "scenario5_desc": "When receiving criticism, resist the immediate urge to defend yourself. Listen carefully, and then calmly ask, 'Is there more?' This allows them to express themselves fully, makes you appear more mature, and buys you time to think.",
  "section_resources": "Mentioned Books & Contexts",
  "resource1_title": "Nonviolent Communication",
  "resource1_desc": "Mentioned when explaining the core idea that 'behind every complaint is an unmet need.' This aligns with the Observe, Feel, Need, Request model in Nonviolent Communication.",
