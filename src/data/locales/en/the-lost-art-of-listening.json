    "summary_title": "Listening: A Gift to Deepen Relationships and Cultivate Self",
    "summary_subtitle": "The Lost Art of Listening",
    "summary_desc": "This book explains why listening is a severely underestimated yet crucial skill. It is not only the cornerstone for improving all interpersonal relationships but also key to shaping personal self-esteem and security. By learning to overcome the instinct to rush to speak, manage emotional interference, and use specific techniques like 'reflecting feelings' and 'confirming understanding,' we can become true 'midwives,' helping others clarify their thoughts and feel understood. This gift of empathy and presence to others ultimately deepens our own life's cultivation.",

    "part1_title": "Part I: Why is Listening So Important?",
    "part1_vp1_title": "Core Viewpoint 1: Listening is an Underestimated Key Skill",
    "part1_vp1_desc": "Listening is widely underestimated as a natural ability, but it is actually the most effective way to improve relationships (parent-child, professional, partner) and requires systematic learning to master. Not being listened to is a form of harm, while being listened to can greatly enhance a person's sense of security and self-esteem.",
    "part1_vp2_title": "Core Viewpoint 2: Listening Shapes Personality and Self-Esteem",
    "part1_vp2_desc": "A person's character and self-confidence are deeply influenced by the extent to which they were listened to while growing up. Children who are listened to by their parents from a young age grow up with a greater sense of security and a stable inner core. The foundation of self-esteem begins in infancy with parents responding to their sounds, which helps a child build the core belief that they are 'worthy of attention.'",
    "part2_title": "Part II: Why Don't We Listen?",
    "part2_vp1_title": "The Instinct to Express Ourselves",
    "part2_vp1_desc": "The most fundamental reason people don't listen is that 'they want to speak.' In a conversation, our brain is always preparing what we want to say, rather than focusing on understanding the other person. When a friend comes to us with a problem, we often rush to give advice, but what they truly need is often emotional release.",
    "part2_vp2_title": "Psychological and Emotional Barriers",
    "part2_vp2_desc": "Personal experiences, emotions, and preconceptions are major obstacles to listening. Past traumas, empathy and projection, and emotional defensiveness when faced with criticism can put us on guard. Especially with those close to us, concern-driven fear often turns into anger, leading to the most hurtful responses.",
    "part3_title": "Part III: How to Listen Effectivelyâ€”Be a Midwife, Not a Dentist",
    "part3_vp1_title": "Mindset Preparation and Basic Techniques",
    "part3_vp1_desc": "Quality listening begins with genuine interest and curiosity. The listener should act as a 'midwife,' helping the other person 'birth' their own ideas, rather than a 'dentist' who rushes to find and fix the problem.",
    "part3_vp1_item1": "<strong>Breathe Deeply and Focus:</strong> Put away your phone and focus your eyes on the other person, creating an undisturbed environment.",
    "part3_vp1_item2": "<strong>Ask and Confirm:</strong> Use open-ended questions to guide deeper expression, and restate their points in your own words ('So what you mean is... is that right?') until they confirm ('Yes, that's exactly what I mean.').",
    "part3_vp1_item3": "<strong>Acknowledgment is Not Agreement:</strong> Understanding and acknowledging the other person's emotions ('No wonder you're so angry.') is key to building a connection, but it doesn't mean you have to agree with their position or actions.",
    "part3_vp2_title": "Responsive Listening and Emotional Processing",
    "part3_vp2_desc": "When dealing with arguments and strong emotions, a structured approach is needed. 'Reflecting feelings' is the most effective tool for handling emotions.",
    "part3_vp2_item1_title": "Steps for Responsive Listening",
    "part3_vp2_item1_step1": "Suppress the impulse to argue and focus on the other person.",

    "part3_vp2_item2_title": "'Reflecting Feelings' Technique",
    "part3_vp2_item2_desc": "State the emotion you observe in the other person. This makes them feel understood and can reduce the intensity of their emotions.",
    "part3_vp2_item2_case1": "<strong>To a child:</strong> 'Daddy knows you want to play a little longer, right?'",
    "part3_vp2_item2_case2": "<strong>To an adult:</strong> 'It sounds like this situation is very frustrating for you.'",
    "part4_title": "Part IV: Listening Strategies in Different Contexts",
    "part4_vp1_title": "Intimate Relationships",
    "part4_vp1_desc": "Stop trying to change your partner and instead listen to the feelings and needs behind their words. To hear the truth, you must provide enough security. Use 'I' statements to express your own feelings ('When you..., I feel hurt.'), avoiding generalizing accusations.",
    "part4_vp2_title": "Family Relationships",
    "part4_vp2_desc": "Establish clear system boundaries. Allow children to express their 'feelings,' acknowledge them first, and then guide them to follow the rules. Avoid nagging and present a united front with your partner in front of the children.",
    "part4_vp3_title": "Friends and Colleagues",
    "part4_vp3_desc": "Friendships are voluntary, and the biggest taboo is constant 'judging.' Before giving advice, ask for permission ('I have some thoughts on this, would you like to hear them?'). Improving relationships starts with changing yourself, not expecting others to change.",

    "scenario4_desc": "When you need to be listened to, make a clear request: 'I'm feeling very overwhelmed right now, can you just listen to me quietly?'",
    "scenario5_title": "When Criticized, First Ask 'Is There More?'",
    "scenario5_desc": "When receiving criticism, resist the urge to defend yourself immediately. Listen attentively and then calmly ask, 'Is there more?' This allows the other person to fully express themselves, makes you appear more mature, and buys you time to think.",
    "section_resources": "Mentioned Books and Contexts",
    "resource1_title": "'Nonviolent Communication'",
    "resource1_desc": "Mentioned when explaining the core idea that 'behind every complaint is an unmet need.' This aligns with the NVC model of observations, feelings, needs, and requests.",
