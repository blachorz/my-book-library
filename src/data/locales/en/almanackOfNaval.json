  "almanackOfNaval_coreConcept_desc": "The core of this book is about creating wealth by 'productizing yourself'—finding your unique talents and leveraging them (especially with zero marginal cost products like code and media). It also explains that happiness is a learnable skill, achieved by living in the present, eliminating feelings of lack, and freeing yourself from desire, anger, and the expectations of others. This leads to a state of 'retirement' where you no longer sacrifice the present for the future, which requires taking full responsibility for your life and building diverse mental models through extensive reading to make better decisions.",
